# Mystery Mob Spawners v3.0.4 Config
# 
# In the spawner-outputs section you can define the spawners that can be recieved
# from the Mystery Mob Spawner. Make sure to use one of the following otherwise it
# won't work.
# 
# Bat, Chicken, Cow, MushroomCow, Pig, Rabbit, Sheep, Squid, Villager, CaveSpider,
# Enderman, Spider, PigZombie, Blaze, Creeper, Endermite, Ghast, Guardian,
# VillagerGolem, SilverFish, Skeleton, Slime, Witch, Zombie, Wolf, EnderDragon,
# Villager, LavaSlime, SnowMan.
# 
# If you can't find the name of a mob that you want to add, go to the wiki at:
# http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/ and then search the mob name. Then on the right
# of the page scroll down a bit until you find 'Savegame ID xxxxxx' and then use
# '/mms add xxxxxx' replacing the 'xxxxxx' with the Savegame ID.
# 
# For the spawner chances you can set the chance of the spawners output, the values
# can equal more then 100% if you like.
# This area does not accept the decimal values for the time being, so please don't
# use them because it will just give an error or not work correctly.
# 
# In the CustomDrops section you can def ine the custom drops including the EXP and the item(s).
# If you use a number then the letter 'r' in the item amount it will choose a random number
# from 1 to the number that you put infront of the 'r' for the drop amount.
# To leave something to default don't set it at all in the config, an example
# of this is below in the CustomDrops section.
